				<p>The historic Washington Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Theta was founded in 1901, and is one of the oldest social Fraternities on campus. Phi Delta Theta has set the standard for fraternal excellence at UW for over 100 years, fostering an elite environment for the cultivation of gentlemen, scholars and athletes.
 
Numerous Olympic, NBA and NFL athletes, Fortune 500 company founders and civic leaders across the nation have passed through the doors of the historic chapter house at 2111 NE 47th St. A few famous Phis from the University of Washington chapter include Tom Tully O’keefe (founder of Tully's Coffee), Aber Whitcomb (co-founder of Myspace), Detlef Schrempf (famous basketball player for the Huskies and the Seattle SuperSonics), William Kirschner (invented the modern fiberglass ski and founded the K2 corporation), Booth Gardner (Governor of the State of Washington, responsible for the running start program in WA), Jack Medica (Olympic swimmer - Gold Medalist), and Michael Callahan (head coach of the Husky rowing team, World Rowing Championship Gold Medalist, Olympic Rower).
 
The opportunity to become a member of Phi Delta Theta allows students to develop a positive fraternity experience and work towards establishing a great reputation on campus. Becoming a member of Phi Delt at UW also provides a professional network of more than 160,000 alumni living throughout North America, and over 3,000 in the Seattle area. For many of Phi Delta Theta's members, their experience allows them to hone their personal leadership skills and prepare for life after college. In the coming school year, Phi Delta Theta offers a unique opportunity for young leaders to follow in the footsteps of Jack Medica, William Kirschner, and nearly 2,500 UW alumni to answer the question: Are You a Leader?
 
The Phi Delta Theta Washington Alpha Chapter is pleased to announce that it is offering $20,000 in scholarships this Summer. Outstanding gentlemen who will be starting  their academic careers at  the University of Washington during the 2014­-2015 academic year are eligible to apply. All students are eligible to receive an award, not only those who plan on joining a Fraternity!</P>

				<p> The University of Washington Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi has a long-standing tradition here on campus. We maintain a well established brotherhood and presence on campus since we were locally founded in 1914. Phi Psi provides more than just a place to live; it provides you with experiences that will shape the rest of your life. We keep a full social calendar, excel in every type of intramural sports, constantly give back to the community through the local Boys and Girls Club, and on top of that maintain a high standard for academic success. We place heavy emphasis on leadership development, offering a wide variety of leadership positions within the house while also supporting involvment on campus and in clubs. Twice a year, our chapter attends the American Leadership Academy in Cabo San Lucas, which is an opportunity unique to Phi Kappa Psi. The cost of the trip is heavily subsidized by alumni and scholarship support, giving anyone the opportunity to attend. This is one of many testaments to our unmatched alumni network and demonstrates how strongly they are involved with our undergraduates. Our scholarship fund is the fourth largest within Phi Kappa Psi nationally, and one of the largest in the UW Greek Community. This endowment fund allows our chapter to award over $21,000 annually to brothers living in the house. We also have a large diversity of interests within our membership, ranging from UW athletes to engineers and musicians. We strive to maintain the perfect balance of academic and social excellence.</P>

				<p>Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity prides itself as a strong brotherhood of gentlemen. Refounded in 2007, we are on the fast track to become the 'Powerhouse of Excellence' as our accomplishments were recognized by the UW IFC awards in Environmental Awareness, Campus Involvement, Recruitment Programming and being a finalist for Greek Relations. We hold ourselves to the principles of: Intellectual Awareness, Social Responsibility, Integrity, and Brotherly Love. To achieve these principles, we strive to live a balanced lifestyle by participating in fun social events, philanthropic involvement, athletics and brotherhood development.

By upholding ourselves to living by these principles truly creates a well rounded college experience and a brotherhood of gentlemen. Our house was completely renovated in 2009 and our amenities include: spacious rooms (no sleeping porch), brotherhood lounge, a study room, and a large parking lot. In the beginning, Zeta Beta Tau was a Jewish fraternity, but we have been non-denominational since 1954. We accept men that meet our membership standards, no matter what their creed is.</P>

				<p>Founded in 1906 by Four Gentlemen, the ideals of Learning, Leading, and Serving are as strong today as they were when it all began over one hundred years ago. Over this time, Phi Kappa Tau’s membership has grown to over 90,000 members (Undergrads and Alumni combined). Scholastics will be the most important task at hand when coming to UW. After Scholastics, there are ample opportunities to develop yourself into a Man of Character. With Leadership Academies and Regional Conferences to inherit leadership skills and meet and network with other Brothers across the nation, you will be more prepared to graduate from a prestigious University and join the working force. And, at the same time, you will have more fun in the process, developing lifelong friendships with Brothers, playing in multiple IMA sports, serving the community to make it a better place for all, and raising money for Camp Korey, a camp developed by Brother Paul Newman meant to be a place for children with illnesses to be kids and raise a little hell. At the end of the day, Phi Kappa Tau’s mission is “To Champion a Lifelong Commitment to Brotherhood, Learning, Ethical Leadership, and Exemplary Character”.

We are consistently strong in grades, ranking in the Top 5 of all fraternities each of the past 10 quarters. We have also been recognized for our excellence in the Greek community, winning 5 IFC awards in 2010. It is the goal of Pi Kappa Phi to be the premier leadership fraternity here on campus, and for our brothers to leave after four years as greater men. We have been at the University of Washington since 1924, and continue to be one of the most active houses in the Greek community.</P>

				<p>Sigma Nu offers a balance of academic excellence, athletic achievement, and close-knit brotherhood combined with diversity and character that remains unrivaled in the Greek system. Our close-knit brotherhood is the foundation of our fraternity. We pride ourselves on having a very well balanced house of individuals that contribute to the whole. As a house, we participate in IMA sports, hold social events, perform community service, and value brotherhood events. Above all, we maintain a standard to keep our house GPA above both the UW all men's average GPA and the all fraternity average GPA. We are a strictly non-hazing house. Hazing is against the founding principles of our national fraternity and our chapter is no exception; we treat our candidates like men--not boys.</P>

				<p>The University of Washington Fiji house is one of the largest fraternities on campus with over 100 members.  We are extremely proud of the strong sense of brotherhood that our members develop while living within our walls.  The commitment we show to academics and community service is unrivaled among the Greek community.  This year marked the 55th consecutive year that our grade point average was above the all men’s average at the University of Washington.  This past February, members of our fraternity worked together to break the Guinness World Record for the longest consecutive flag football game, playing for 54 straight hours through a record-breaking rain and wind storm down at Husky Stadium and fundraising over $33,000 for Run to Win.  In 2012, members of 4503 embarked on the ‘Journey from the Tourney,’ an 1100-mile relay run from Las Vegas to Seattle, which raised over $35,000 for Home Court NW.  Fiji’s hold themselves to the highest standard and look to improve on the marks they set the year prior. The Fiji house welcomes you and any questions you may have; we encourage you to contact our rush chairs or visit our website atwww.huskyfiji.net for more information. </P>
